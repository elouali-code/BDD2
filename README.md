# Database project

Project information : 
``` sh

The objective of this project is to create a database that meets a need
mentioned in a specification. And to meet this need, we have
started with a design of a UML model followed by a relational model
of which we applied the 3 forms of normalization. Afterwards we moved on to the phase of
realization which results in the creation and the filling of the tables including
our database via SQL commands, in addition to the use of a
graphical interface that allows you to clearly view the tables created. In order to be sure
the effectiveness of the models produced and the tables created, a test phase remains
essential which manifests itself via SQL queries making it possible to ensure
the efficiency and proper functioning of our database created, in such a way
apply complex queries containing multiple joins and other tools
of the SQL language.
